## Installation:
- Install the project dependencies: ` yarn install `
- Run metro bundler by expo cli ` expo start `
- Download the Expo Go app from the Play Store or App Store and scan the QR code

## Tech stack:
- React Native
- Expo
- Styled-components
- React-query
- Axios
- Formik
- Yup
- Eslint
- Prettier
- Lint-staged

## Notes:
- Due to lack of testing capabilities, the app was only tested on an Android device.
- The font used in the project is paid, I used a similar free replacement.
- According to my CV I have no experience in typescript. I think if I had more time to learn the typescript patterns the project could be better.
- For query and state I used react-query because it is faster to write. It is possible to easily rewrite to e.g. redux toolkit.
